# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player uses X and the other O. They take turns marking empty squares, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first to do so wins; if all squares are filled without a winner, it’s a draw.
